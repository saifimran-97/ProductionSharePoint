## Full Description on changes

### New Scan myTool page

Due to overwhelming request by Production staff, we make a easier way for staff to scan location barcodes.
- In the Scan myTool page, we put a tab control where users can change to different departments to minimize the amount of barcodes to display.

- When the location is prompted / asked, user may change the tab to the preferred department to filter down the amount of barcodes on screen.
	

    > 1. Due to system limitation, the tab control is locked/disable at all times **except** when the location is prompted.
    > 2. After the location is scanned, the tab control is locked again to **prevent** any system error or wrongly scanned.
